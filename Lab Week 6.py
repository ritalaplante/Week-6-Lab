#Part 1: Nested For loops
# 1. Print a triangle of numbers: ask the user for an numerical input and then
# print out a triangle as follows: if the user input is 5 you should print:
# 1
# 2 2
# 3 3 3
# 4 4 4 4
# 5 5 5 5 5

# 2. Write a similar function, but instead print out the exponents. i.e if user
# input is 5 you want to print
# 1
# 2 4
# 3 9 27
# 4 16 64 256
# 5 25 125 625 3125

#3. Print week and day. Ask user to input a number of weeks and a number of days.
# for each week you want to print the days below it. For example: If weeks = 2 and
# days = 3 you want to print
# Week 1:
    # Day 1
    # Day 2
    # Day 3
# Week 2:
    # Day 1
    # Day 2
    # Day 3

#Part 2: return values
# 1. Write a function that calculates the perimeter of a rectangle. This function
# should take in two side lenghts as arguments and return the perimeter value.

# Write a function that reverses a string. Instead of printing the reversed string
# the function should return the reversed string which is printed in the main
# function.
